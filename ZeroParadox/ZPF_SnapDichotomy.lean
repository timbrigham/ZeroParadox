# ZPF_SnapDichotomy — the snap-occurrence dichotomy over ℚ

## Engineer's Take

TODO (Tim): Engineer's Take — your own words.

## Overview

Completes ZP-F's "Classification Note": the Binary Snap's domain of validity is exactly the
non-Archimedean completions of ℚ. Unifies three previously separate facts under ONE statement,
with "snap occurs" formalized topologically as **total disconnectedness** (predicate (a)):

- ℝ (the Archimedean completion): connected, NOT totally disconnected → no snap.
  (Order-language companion: ZP-F `ZeroParadox.ZPF.f_snap_impossible`.)
- ℚ_p (the non-Archimedean completions): totally disconnected → snap.
  (ZP-B anchor: `ZeroParadox.ZPB.t5_totallyDisconnected`, itself `inferInstance` from Mathlib.)
- Ostrowski (ZP-P, `ZPP_Ostrowski`): these are the ONLY completions, and they are mutually exclusive.

## Why topological (predicate (a), Tim 2026-06-24)
The only NON-CIRCULAR choice: "snap := non-Archimedean" just renames Ostrowski. Total disconnectedness
is a genuinely different property whose coincidence with the Ostrowski class is real content. Both
witnesses are Mathlib-solid; the dichotomy reuses ZP-P's Ostrowski backbone + ZP-B's topology anchor.

## Symbol map (concept → Lean/Mathlib)
- "snap occurs"             → `TotallyDisconnectedSpace K`  (K a completion of ℚ)
- ℝ completion              → `ℝ`; connected via `Real.instPathConnectedSpace`
- ℚ_p completion            → `ℚ_[p]` = `Padic p` `[Fact p.Prime]`; totally disconnected = inferInstance
- "no order-atom" (ℝ side)  → `ZeroParadox.ZPF.f_snap_impossible` (order companion)
- Ostrowski exhaustiveness  → `ZeroParadox.ZPP.completions_exhaustive` (`equiv_real_or_padic`)
- Ostrowski orthogonality   → `ZeroParadox.ZPP.real_not_equiv_padic` (`not_real_isEquiv_padic`)
- "ℝ not totally disc."     → ℝ connected + nontrivial → ¬ `TotallyDisconnectedSpace ℝ`   [NEW lemma]

## Scope / honest seam
v1 states the dichotomy as a faithful BUNDLE over the concrete completions (ℝ, ℚ_p) + the Ostrowski
classification of abstract absolute values. The implicit seam — "f ≈ real ⇒ completion is ℝ", "f ≈ padic p
⇒ completion is ℚ_p" — is left to the reader (it is standard); a single biconditional quantifying over the
abstract completion `UniformSpace.Completion` is the v2 polish (carries the completion-transport plumbing).

STATUS: PROVED (v1 bundle), sorry-free. Reuses ZP-P's Ostrowski backbone + Mathlib's
ultrametric/connected instances; the only new lemma is `real_no_snap`.
