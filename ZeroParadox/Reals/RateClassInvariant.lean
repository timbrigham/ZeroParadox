# Axis IV: convergence-rate class as a cross-root invariant

## Engineer's Take

This file is one of a series of iterative attempts on this branch to build a map of how the various
bottoms interconnect, and by extension how bottom moves from being the floor, a thing (a noun), to a
verb (an action). The Lean here is our attempt, one way or the other, to get a clean verification. I
defer to my AI assistant regarding the specifics of how the internals work.

---

## Formal Overview (AI-assisted)

`ZeroParadox/Valuation/NuRateEdge.lean` and `ZeroParadox/Valuation/RateTransport.lean` established that the p-adic ν-floor (#3, geometric orbit `2⁻ⁿ`) and the Markov
attractor (#2, absorbing) are *rate*-obstructed. This file probes a finer question: among
sequences that all reach the floor, is **convergence-rate class** (geometric vs linear) a
separating invariant that cuts *across* the well-founded/non-well-founded root (Axis I)?

The objects under test are three concrete descent sequences to the floor:

- **geometric** `g n = 2⁻ⁿ` (the #3 p-adic orbit's rate; never reaches `0` over ℝ);
- **linear / Goodstein-style** `a₀ - n` (the canonical finite well-founded descent, #1);
- **binary-halving** `⌊a₀ / 2ⁿ⌋` (a well-founded ℕ-descent that is *also* geometric base ½).

"Rate-preserving correspondence" between two nonnegative sequences `s, t` is taken to be a
**bounded ratio**: `∃ C, ∀ n, s n ≤ C · t n`. Two sequences are *rate-matched* when each
bounds the other up to a constant; *rate-separated* when no such constant exists in (at least)
one direction.

### What is proved (load-bearing, in-statement)

- `linear_overtakes_geometric` — **the NO-GO (Axis IV separation).** No constant `C` makes the
  linear count `n` bounded by `C · 2⁻ⁿ`: for every `C` there is an `n` with `(n:ℝ) > C · 2⁻ⁿ`.
  Geometric decay strictly out-paces linear, so there is *no* rate-preserving map from a linear
  descent into the geometric orbit. This is a genuine cross-root wall (linear descent is #1, a
  μ/well-founded object; geometric orbit is #3, a ν object) that is **finer than Axis I** —
  it separates by rate class, not by well-foundedness.

- `halving_dominated_by_geometric` — **the refined GO (one direction only).** The binary-halving
  ℕ-descent *is* in the geometric rate class from above: `(⌊a₀/2ⁿ⌋ : ℝ) ≤ a₀ · 2⁻ⁿ` for all `n`.
  So a geometric μ-descent is bounded by a constant times the geometric ν-orbit — the within-class
  reconciliation the GO conjecture predicted, but **only as an upper envelope**.

- `halving_terminates` / `halving_not_matched_below` — **the honest twist that defeats the literal
  two-sided GO.** The binary-halving descent over ℕ *reaches `0` in finitely many steps*
  (`⌊a₀/2ⁿ⌋ = 0` once `a₀ < 2ⁿ`), whereas `2⁻ⁿ > 0` for every `n`. Hence there is **no** lower
  rate-match `∃ c > 0, ∀ n, c · 2⁻ⁿ ≤ ⌊a₀/2ⁿ⌋`: the well-founded ℕ-descent and the real geometric
  orbit are rate-separated *below* even when they share the base ½. Well-foundedness reasserts
  itself as a tail phenomenon: terminating descent cannot two-sidedly track a non-terminating orbit.

### Honest verdict — NO-GO (with a one-sided GO), opening Axis IV

The pre-registered GO ("a geometric ℕ-descent rate-MATCHES the geometric orbit") holds only as an
*upper* envelope; the literal two-sided match is **false** because the ℕ-descent terminates. The
pre-registered NO-GO (linear is rate-incompatible with geometric) **proves**. Together:
convergence-rate class is a real separating invariant (Axis IV) — but the cleanest reading is that
*termination* (the μ/well-founded signature) is what blocks the two-sided match, so Axis IV does not
fully decouple from Axis I; it refines it. No single constant reconciles a terminating descent with
a non-terminating orbit, in either the linear or the geometric base.

### What is interpretation, not Lean

The labels "#1/#2/#3", "Axis IV", "cross-root", and the tree placement are framework reading. The
Lean content is exactly: three explicit real/ℕ sequences and two-sided bounded-ratio (non-)existence
facts about them. No categorical or p-adic object is invoked here — the claim is purely about the
*rate functions* those bottoms converge at.

    (well-founded vs not), since it ranks two descents that both reach the floor. -/

/-! ### The honest twist — binary halving TERMINATES, so the two-sided match FAILS -/

/-- The binary-halving ℕ-descent reaches `0` in finitely many steps: once `a₀ < 2ⁿ`,
    `⌊a₀ / 2ⁿ⌋ = 0`. (`a₀ < 2^(a₀)` always, so `n = a₀` suffices.) -/

/-- **The honest twist (load-bearing NO-GO below).** There is *no* lower rate-match between the
    binary-halving ℕ-descent and the geometric real orbit: no positive constant `c` satisfies
    `c · 2⁻ⁿ ≤ ⌊a₀/2ⁿ⌋` for all `n`, because the left side stays strictly positive while the right
    side becomes `0` once the descent terminates. So even sharing base ½, the *terminating*
    well-founded ℕ-descent (#1, μ) and the *non-terminating* geometric orbit (#3, ν) are
    rate-separated below — termination (the μ signature) blocks the two-sided match. -/

/-- **capstone (Axis IV, witnessed not narrated).** The three rate facts, bundled:
    (a) linear descent overtakes any constant multiple of the geometric orbit — no rate-preserving
    map linear→geometric (the NO-GO wall); (b) binary halving is dominated by the geometric orbit
    up to constant `a₀` (the one-sided GO); (c) binary halving has *no* lower rate-match with the
    geometric orbit because it terminates. So convergence-rate class is a genuine separating
    invariant, but the two-sided match is blocked by termination — Axis IV refines, rather than
    decouples from, the well-founded fork (Axis I). -/
