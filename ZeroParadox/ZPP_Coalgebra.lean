# ZP-P instance: the categorical parent (initial algebra vs final coalgebra)

The categorical-parent instance of the fixed-point fork (ZP-P). The set-theory fork
(ZFC+Foundation / ZFC+AFA) is the powerset-functor case of a general categorical fork: for an
endofunctor, the **initial algebra** (least fixed point μ, the well-founded / inductive closure) versus
the **final coalgebra** (greatest fixed point ν, the non-well-founded / coinductive closure). Mathlib
realises these for a QPF as `QPF.Fix` (the W-type) and `QPF.Cofix` (the M-type).

This file exhibits the strictest possible form of the fork on a concrete functor. Take the one-shape,
one-child polynomial functor `idPF` (`A = PUnit`, `B = fun _ => PUnit`), which has no leaf constructor.
Then:

- **`Fix idPF.Obj` is empty** — there is no finite, well-founded element, because every element would
  need a child and there is no base case. The least-fixed-point (inductive) closure is empty.
- **`Cofix idPF.Obj` is inhabited** — the infinite self-referential element exists (built by
  corecursion: the node that unfolds to itself forever). The greatest-fixed-point (coinductive)
  closure contains it.

So the non-well-founded closure contains a self-referential element that the well-founded closure
lacks. This is the categorical analog of the Quine atom living in νF \ μF: the contact point of the
fork is exactly the self-referential element that ν admits and μ forbids — the same shape as
ZFC+Foundation (no ⊥={⊥}) vs ZFC+AFA (⊥={⊥}) (set theory: ZP-J).

**FENCE.** This is the genuine μ/ν instance of the schema (unlike the Ostrowski number-system instance,
which is theorem-backed but not a μ/ν instance). What is claimed here is exactly the two Lean theorems
below: `Fix` empty, `Cofix` inhabited, for this functor. The identification of this categorical contact
point with the diagonal fixed point of the other layers is the cross-instance identity — a modeling
commitment, not a theorem (ZP-P hard fence).

## Status

PROVED. Two theorems, no `sorry`. Split axiom footprint: `fix_isEmpty` (μ empty) is choice-free
`[propext, Quot.sound]`; `cofix_nonempty` (ν inhabited) carries `Classical.choice` from Mathlib's
M-type / corecursion machinery. See PurityCheck.

/-! ## Engineer's Take

These files sit at the boundary of where choice lives within the framework. There is a distinct boundary
between the theorems that define the Zero Paradox framework itself and the individual implementations of
the tooling, and that boundary is the same for set theory, coalgebra, and p-adics. This is a synthesis
layer: a validation tool, a unit test to represent that concept quickly.

Here the dataset is the leaf-free polynomial functor `idPF`: its W-type (`QPF.Fix`, μ) is empty and
choice-free, while its M-type (`QPF.Cofix`, ν) is inhabited and carries choice inherited from Mathlib, with
choice entering exactly on the non-well-founded, self-referential side.

-- Split footprint, and the split is meaningful:
--   fix_isEmpty (μ is empty)        : [propext, Quot.sound]                     — CHOICE-FREE
--   cofix_nonempty (ν is inhabited) : [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]  — choice-carrying
--   categorical_fork_strict         : inherits Classical.choice from cofix_nonempty
-- The well-founded (inductive) side is constructive; the non-well-founded (coinductive) side carries
-- Classical.choice, inherited from Mathlib's M-type / corecursion machinery. Fitting: the
-- self-referential element that ν admits and μ forbids is exactly where choice enters. The fork spine
-- (`ZeroParadox.ZPP.fork_collapse_iff`) is fully choice-free. See AxiomProfile.lean.
